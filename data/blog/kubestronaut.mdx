With 40 days of Ramadan post-fotour study sessions and a few self-doubt moments, I officially became a Kubestronaut by passing the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) exam with 83%.

---

One random saturday in janurary this year, I decided I wanted to become a Kubestronaut. For no reason in particular but balancing the imposter syndrome by actually learning something new and filling the gaps.

It was already past the cyber monday where all the Kubernetes certifications were on sale, but I didn't care. I just wanted to become a Kubestronaut. I had one -50% coupon left from my previous purchase of CKA.

So I used it to buy a [ KCSA+CKS Cert Bundle ] and bought the KCNA at full price üò¢. totalling $1130.75 for all the certifications üí∏üí∏üí∏

### What is this Kubestronaut?

well, it has nothing to do with NASA üöÄ but it is about exploring the galaxys of kubernetes, and the credentials that certify you have indeed visited few planets ü™ê there.

### Why become one?

Not all certificates are equal, this one doesn't just lend itself to you, it challenges you, and you will certainly learn a lot of things about more than just kubernetes before you get it.

I certainly battled my insecurities and imposter syndrome, while preparing, I learned few terminal tricks and how to navigate the darkness of the terminal on vim. I was introduced to security and learned a lot of things that I am now applying at my currenct job, and they took my understanding and application from the novice level the the expert level.

If you have space time and passion for learning and you are using kubernetes, giving this a shot is a great idea.

it might also be a waste of time of others who aren't really Kubestronauts, and are just here for the hype and display credentials to HR to get through.

by all means best of luck.

### How to get there?

You have to pass 5 certifications: CKA, CKAD, CKS, KCNA, KCSA.

- Associate level: KCNA, KCSA -- Exams are multi-choice about 60 questions, and you get your results right after.
- Intermediate level: CKA, CKAD -- Exams are hands on, on kubernetes clusters, 15-20 questions, and you get 24hours after finishing the exam.
- Expert level: CKS -- Exams are hands on, on kubernetes clusters, 15-20 questions, and you get 24hours after finishing the exam.

Normal people should start with the associate level, but most people going after this aren't normal, so they start with CKAD or CKA them finish with CKS only after they finish the god-level do they go for the beginner level KCNA and KCSA.

That's what I did, I started with CKAD, then CKA, then KCNA to warmup for CKS, then KCSA.

It makes sense to pass CKS and CKA before KCNA and KCSA, because if you prepare for the hardest exams first, you only need light preparation for the associate level exams.

while if you passed KCNA and KCSA first, you will still need full preparatio for CKA, CKAD and CKS. so that's how you optimize your time and effort.

I wrote some notes and tips about the exams and the journey [here](/blog/CKS)

I passed the 3 certifications in the span of about 2 month:

- KCNA: aquired on 1st of March
- CKS: aquired on 13th of April
- KCSA: aquired on 22nd of April

I already had CKA and CKAD from last year.

- 01/03/2025 I started my preparations for CKS as Ive decided going for KSCA would I will have to study all the materials and more in order to pass CKS, so I decided to go for CKS first and then KSCA.

- 06/03/2025 Asked the AI again about my ability to take the exam just with kodekloud resources, given my current knowledge and experience, it said I can do it.
  as I have been dealing with managed kubernetes clusters my security and administration aren't my strongest skills at the moment.
  preparing for the exam is the best way I can learn about these areas, improve my skills, and also apply what I learned to cover these blind spots that the companies I work at
  might have.
